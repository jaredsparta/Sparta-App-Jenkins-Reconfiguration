# Cloud vs. On-site

- Use cases depend, there are some scenarios where on-site infrastructure makes sense but most of time it's better to use cloud deployment

1. Many start-ups will tend to fail, although not immediately. If they invest in on-site infrastructure and, in the next few years, fail to grow or receive investments sufficiently they will have spent alot on capital and will not receive returns for it. There is also the operational costs of private servers to consider.
    - Buying servers requires an extremely precise prediction on the success of the app -- which is very hard to do in the current climate (the app market is so saturated)
    - If you oversuceed then your private servers will not be enough to keep up with the capacity of the users that use it and you will lose business because of it
    - If the app doesn't succeed as you would like it to then you will have to deal with initial capital you invested in the on-site servers which you could have invested in other sources such as the development of the app (which would likely increase the likelihood of it's success)

2. Cloud deployment is extremely flexible, you pay only for what you use. Extremely good for start-ups who will usually struggle for the first few years. Furthermore, it also allows you to deploy globally as soon as you're ready. There is also very little in the way of operational costs (if any) and the company would not need to even estimate usage to the same precision as if they had on-site servers.
